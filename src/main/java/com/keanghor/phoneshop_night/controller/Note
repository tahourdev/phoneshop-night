* Controller

The BrandController class is a REST controller that handles HTTP requests related to Brand operations.
It uses Spring's @RestController and @RequestMapping annotations to define request mappings.

1. Create Brand:
    This method receives a BrandDTO, converts it to a Brand entity,
    saves it using the brandService, and returns the saved Brand as a BrandDTO.

2. Get a Brand by ID:
    This method retrieves a Brand by its ID through the brandService, converts it to BrandDTO, and returns it.
