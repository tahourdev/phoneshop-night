* Entity Layer
    The Brand class is an entity that maps to the brands table in the database.
    It uses JPA annotations to define the table structure:

    1. @Entity and @Table indicate that this class is a JPA entity mapped to the brands table.
    2. @Id and @GeneratedValue define the primary key and its generation strategy.
